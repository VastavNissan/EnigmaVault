## ✨ What's Inside? ✨

Dive deep into the mechanics of secrecy! Here's a glimpse of the cryptographic algorithms you'll find:

- **Monoalphabetic Cipher** 🔡: Simple substitution at its core.
- **Caesar Cipher** 🏛️: The ancient Roman's secret code.
- **Vigenere Cipher** 📜: A polyalphabetic classic that adds more complexity.
- **Hill Cipher** 🔢: Matrix magic for encryption!
- **Affine Cipher** ➕✖️: Combining multiplication and addition for secrecy.
- **Playfair Cipher** 🎲: Encrypting digraphs for tougher codes.
- **One-Time Pad (OTP)** 🔑: The unbreakable cipher (if used correctly!).
- **RSA Algorithm** 🔒: Your entry into modern public-key cryptography.
- **Transposition Technique** 🔄: Rearranging letters for a different kind of scramble.

Each program is designed to be clear, offering hands-on examples to help you grasp the underlying principles of encryption and decryption techniques.

## 🚀 Getting Started 🚀

Ready to encrypt your first message? Follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository** ⬇️:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/EnigmaVault.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/EnigmaVault.git)
    cd EnigmaVault
    ```
2.  **Compile a Program** 🛠️:
    Navigate to the specific cipher's directory (e.g., `caesar_cipher/`) and compile the C++ source file using a g++ compiler.
    ```bash
    g++ caesar_cipher/caesar.cpp -o caesar_cipher/caesar
    ```
3.  **Run the Program** ▶️:
    Execute the compiled program. Each cipher will have its own interactive prompts or command-line arguments.
    ```bash
    ./caesar_cipher/caesar
    ```
    _Refer to the individual cipher directories for specific usage instructions and examples!_
